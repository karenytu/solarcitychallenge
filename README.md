* A description of the problem and solution.
* While all submissions are expected to be a full stack application, let us know whether your solution is more focused on back-end, front-end or full stack development (While most of our engineers work full stack in some capacity, for the purpose of the coding challenge no preference is paid towards any specific track.).
* Reasoning behind your technical choices. Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.
* (Optional) Link to other code you're particularly proud of.
